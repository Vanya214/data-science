# Data Science
Some general machine learning exercises one can run to get used to python's
scientific computing libraries.

Some popular tasks that are currently missing are:
-Regression
-Multitask Classification
-Clustering (It's hard to get ground truth data sets)
-Text mining (Again, hard to obtain ground truth)
-Computer Vision (Not my area of specialty)

This repository primarily fetches from the UCI machine learning repository.
Please `cd data` to see the fetching scripts, and the URLs for each address.

# The virtual environment
The virtual environment should give you access to the popular scientific
computing library to run the python scripts in this project. To activate the
computing libraries, just type

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

in the project's root folder.

# Contributing to this project
Some ground rules
1. Use 4 spaced indents, no tabs.
2. Always make sure your code works in the virtual environment.
3. Try to keep lines within 80 characters (PEP 8 says 79)
